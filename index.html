            Music is not only a passion but also a mode of relaxing, playing songs or tunes on pianos or keyboard makes us fell peaceful and calm. Although it is not so easy to play it , but the intrest and effort make it easier.Practise also plays a very important role in it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Learning to play an instrument increases motor control, listening, memory (especially of audio information). The benefits extend beyond the activity of playing the piano into your everyday lives. They impact ability to plan, coordination, language skills, attention span and alertness.
            <br>
            <br>
            The basic steps to play a scale is to understand it and sing it aloud in its actuall tune. Even while practising we have to keep singing either the scales or the song to make it a good play.

            I stared learning piano in 1st class in school. I played scales and rhymes like "God's Love" and "Happy Birthday". I stopped learning piano in 2nd class. I thought that I can learn it myself. So I asked my aunt for piano notes and by memorising the basics which I learned in school, I learned to play songs like "Jana Gana Mana" our National Anthem.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            I got a chance to play the National Anthem on Independece Day event. After that I practised my old children rhymes on piano. And started teaching my younger brother and sister during the last summer. I thought them Happy Birthday , Twinkle Twinkle and Baby Shark.

            During May-June my cousin sister visited my house. She came from California,US and wanted to meet me. I had two pianos.She learns Violin and I learn piano. So we played tricky chalenges like exchanging our notes. I also learned to play her notes on piano. I also taught her to play basic notes on piano.
